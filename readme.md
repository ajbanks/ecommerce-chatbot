#Test
This is the implementation of a chatbot coding test

This technical test consists of two parts. You only have to complete one of the two. Depending on your expertise and experience you can choose to implement a purely NLP task or a CV/NLP Multi-Modal task. 

# General Requirements 
Successful implementation will include: 
All the necessary steps and requirements to run and reproduce results Clear code with documentation 
A text document outlining the implementation process and time taken for each step SOTA concepts (feel free to cite relevant papers/sources) 

#Dataset 
The Google Drive link contains an articles.csv with a list of Womenâ€™s products. Each article/item has a free text title and description and some other categorical information. Most of the articles also have associated product images in the images directory. You 
are free to transform the data points or use additional datasets to support your ML methods.
